**Updated with feedback received on [an earlier post](https://new.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/8z960a/expected_in_gen_4_sinnoh_evolution_and_babies/)**

**Data sources** I primarily used are, Ranked Boost and GamePress. There are some conflicting CP values; in those cases I took GamePress's value since they  seem to have updated data.

**Evolution Notes**: I know some evolutions in main game are based on special conditions or moves etc. Left them aside from the graphic for simplicity's sake for now. Here are some notes:
* Moves:
   * Ambipom: Double Hit
   * Lickilicky: Rollout
   * Tangrowth: Ancient Power
   * Yanmega: Ancient Power 
   * Mamoswine: Ancient Power 
* At Night:
   * Weavile
   * Gliscor 
* Evovles when traded:
   * Electivire 
   * Magmortar 
   * Porygon-Z 
   * Dusknoir 
* Special area/location:
   * Magnezone - Special magnetic field
   * Probopass - Special magnetic field
   * Leafeon - near Moss Rock
   * Glaceon - near Ice Rock
   

**P.S.:** Mamoswine and Rhyperior are the most meta relevant of these. Also pay attention to collect more Togepi, Tangela, Roselia candies since they'd likely evolve to best/one of the best on their types. Gardevoir turned out to be underwhelming in PoGO, so don't let your hopes go up for Gallade either. I found this study to be helpful: [List of Gen4 meta-relevant attackers by type](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/8ykagf/list_of_gen4_metarelevant_attackers_by_type/).

I really appreciate all the feedback I received in original post and feeling happy to post this updated version. If you find any more issue please report [here](https://github.com/nafSadh/infographic/issues).

Good luck! Can't wait for Gen 4.
